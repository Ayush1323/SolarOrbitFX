## SolarOrbitFX

OrbitUI System is a fully responsive orbit-style animation built with pure HTML & CSS, visualizing features as planets revolving around a central logo—just like a solar system.

This project demonstrates creative UI motion design, layered orbits, smooth circular paths, subtle glow effects, and component-based animations without JavaScript.

Ideal for dashboards, SaaS landing pages, or modern interactive presentations where you want to highlight core modules orbiting around a central product.
